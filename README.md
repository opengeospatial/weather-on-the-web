# weather-on-the-web
A public repository of the OGC MetOcean Domain Working Group

The purpose of Weather on the Web is to clarify and formalise the weather related standards landscape that enables the development and use of weather based web services: 

- to determine how weather* information can best be integrated with other data on the Web; 
- to define a range of access patterns and encoding extensions** that cover a set of core use cases specified; 
- to identify and assess existing methods and tools; 
- to drive consensus on weather standards for the web;
- and to produce a set of best practice for use of weather information on the web.

Weather on the Web is solely focused on data APIs as opposed to product APIs, in which specific business logic and understanding the context of use is required to add further value. 

Weather on the Web will not consider Use Cases that require specific business knowledge of the end use. 

*Weather meaning any meteorological information that covers past present and future state of the atmosphere including observations and climatological data.

**encoding extensions: for example specifying GeoJSON structures for describing weather at a specific location.
